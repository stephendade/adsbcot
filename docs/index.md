ADSBCOT is software for monitoring and analyzing aviation surveillance data via the Team Awareness Kit (TAK) ecosystem of products.

ADSBCOT captures & reports real-time ADS-B data received from aircraft (and other airborne vehicles & drones) into TAK products using native TAK protocols, including Cursor on Target (CoT). 

ADSBCOT has been evaluated with WinTAK, iTAK, ATAK & TAK Server.

ADSBCOT is in active use today in a variety of missions.
